NAME
    Vim::Tag - Generate perl tags for vim

SYNOPSIS
        $ ptags --use ~/code/coderepos -o ~/.ptags

    In ".vimrc":

        set tags+=~/.ptags

    then this works in vim:

        :ta Foo::Bar
        :ta my_subroutine

    bash completion:

        alias vit='vi -t'
        _ptags()
        {
            COMPREPLY=( $(grep -h ^${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]} ~/.ptags | cut -f 1) )
            return 0
        }
        complete -F _ptags vit

    then you can do:

        $ vit Foo::Bar
        $ vit Foo--Bar     # easier to complete on than double-colons
        $ vit my_subroutine

    Custom tag generation

        package Foo::Bar;

        $::PTAGS && $::PTAGS->add_tag($tag, $filename, $line);

DESCRIPTION
    Manage tags for perl code in vim, with ideas on integrating tags with
    the bash programmable completion project. See the synopsis.

    You should subclass this class to use it in your "ptags"-generating
    application. It could be as simple as that:

        #!/usr/bin/env perl
        use warnings;
        use strict;
        use base qw(Vim::Tag);
        main->new->run;

    And if you want just that, there's the "ptags" program. But it is more
    interesting to extend this with custom aliases and to have your modules
    generate custom tags and so on. The documentation on those features is a
    bit sparse at the moment, but take a look in this distribution's
    "examples/" directory.

METHODS
    "add_tag"
        Takes a tag name, a filename and a 'search' argument that can either
        be a line number which caused the tag, or a vim search pattern which
        will jump to the tag. It will add the tag to the "tags" hash.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    No bugs have been reported.
